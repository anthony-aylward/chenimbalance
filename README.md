This package contains utilities for estimating a beta-binomial overdispersion parameter from epigenomic sequencing data, as in [Chen et al. 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837449/).

Compare the results of the included [vignette](https://github.com/anthony-aylward/chenimbalance/blob/master/vignettes/overdispersion.md) to Fig. 2 of that paper.

The code was adapted from the authors' R script found in the  [alleleDB pipeline](https://github.com/gersteinlab/alleleDB/blob/release/v2.0/alleledb_pipeline/)
